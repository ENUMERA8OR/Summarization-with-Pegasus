PEGASUS Text Summarization Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the PEGASUS (Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization) model, a state-of-the-art text summarization model developed by Google AI. The PEGASUS model is particularly effective at abstractive text summarization, generating concise and informative summaries while capturing the key points of the input text. The code in this repository demonstrates how to load and utilize the pre-trained PEGASUS model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It includes examples of tokenizing input text, generating summaries using the model, and decoding the model's output.

The repository serves as a valuable resource for those interested in exploring text summarization techniques, experimenting with state-of-the-art language models, or integrating summarization capabilities into their projects.

It contains the following files:
1. PDF of Google colab notebook
2. Goolge Colab Notebook
3. Video Showcasing implemetation in real time
4. README file
